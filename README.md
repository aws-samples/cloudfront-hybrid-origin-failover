# Blog - Improve web application's availability with hybrid failover using CloudFront and Route 53 ðŸš€

## Solution's objectives

The objective of this code, is to allow you to quickly test the benefits of using a hybrid failover solution using Cloudfront Origin Failover and Route53.

The solution will achieve the following:
* Create an API Endpoint using AWS API Gateway and Lambda on both Primary and Backup Regions (with custom domain name + certificate)
* Create a Route53 healthcheck for both API Endpoints
* Create a Route53 DNS entry, with an Alias for both Primary and Secondary API Endpoint
* Create two (02) Cloudfront Distributions with the following setup:
  * Setup 1: Configured with Route53 failover dns record as Origin
  * Setup 2: Configured with Origin failover group. Route 53 failover dns record as primary and secondary API gateway as a fallback.
* Export both Cloudfront distrbutions' domain names to allow you to test both solutions.


## Architecture

## Solution Requirements
* Required privileges to create AWS resources in two different regions
* Public domain hosted on Amazon Route53
* Node.JS installed (as AWS CDK uses Node.js). Visit https://nodejs.org/ to install.
* AWS CDK Toolkit installed `npm install -g aws-cdk`

## Deploy the solution

Deploy this stack to your Primary and Fallback Region:
```
git clone https://gitlab.aws.dev/chakibsa/cloudfront-hybrid-origin-failover.git
cd cloudfront-hybrid-origin-failover
./deployment/deploy.sh AWS_REGION AWS_BACKUP_REGION DOMAIN_NAME HOSTED_ZONE_ID
```


Required Arguments:
* AWS_REGION: Allow you to specify your Primary Region
* AWS_BACKUP_REGION: Allow you to specify your Fallback Region
* DOMAIN_NAME: This stack will require you to have a public domain name hosted on Amazon Route53. Provide your domain name
* HOSTED_ZONE_ID: This stack will require you to have a public domain name hosted on Amazon Route53. Provide your Hosted Zone ID

Deployment example
```
./deployment/deploy.sh eu-west-1 us-east-1 mydomain.com Z0XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

At the end of the deployment, you can find an export of the FQDN of 2 Cloudfront distributions:
* Setup 1: Cloudfront Distribution with Route53 failover DNS record as origin
* * Export Name = R53FailoverDistribDomain
* Setup 2: Cloudfront Distribution with Combined Route53 Failover with Cloudfront Origin Failover 
* * Export Name = CombinedFailoverDistribDomain

```
Outputs:
CdkRegionStack.CombinedFailoverDistribDomain = https://XXXXXXX.cloudfront.net/prod
CdkRegionStack.R53FailoverDistribDomain = https://YYYYYYYY.cloudfront.net/prod
```

## Testing
In order to test both failover solutions, you could use the following bash script. You will need to provide the previously exported Cloudfront Distribution URL 

```
./testing/test.sh https://xxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net/prod
```

## Clean Up
To destroy the stack from your Primary and Fallback Region:
```
./deployment/destroy.sh AWS_REGION AWS_BACKUP_REGION DOMAIN_NAME HOSTED_ZONE_ID
```

Destroy example
```
./deployment/destroy.sh eu-west-1 us-east-1 mydomain.com Z0XXXXXXXXXXXX
```
